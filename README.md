# SQL-Project---IPL-2025-Qualifier-1-Analysis
# 📊 SQL Project – IPL 2025 Qualifier Match Data Analysis (RCB 🆚 PBKS) 🏏
# In this project, I analyzed ball-by-ball data from a high-stakes IPL 2025 Qualifier 1 match between Royal Challengers Bangalore and Punjab Kings using structured match data in MySQL.
# 🔍 What I Did:
# - Collected and structured raw match data into two innings datasets with relational schema using PRIMARY and FOREIGN keys
# - Imported and inserted 100+ rows of real-time match data for both teams
# - Used SQL Window Functions (RANK, NTILE, ROW_NUMBER), CASE, and Aggregations
# - Performed player-wise and over-wise performance analysis
# - Calculated cumulative scores, ranked bowlers, and analyzed batting phases
# - Created comparative dashboards for batter performance and dismissal types
# 🛠️ Tools & Skills Used:
#  MySQL, SQL Joins, Window Functions, Aggregations, Grouping, Subqueries, Match Data Analysis
# This project helped sharpen my SQL and analytical thinking by applying it to a live match scenario, showing how data can drive strategic insights even in sports.
